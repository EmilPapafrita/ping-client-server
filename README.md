# ping-client-server

This assignment contains a PING server and PING client program that was written in Java. The server listens on a specified port and receives PING packets from clients. These packets include both headers and payloads, with the server capable of simulating packet loss based on a defined loss percentage. The server parses incoming packets to extract variables, such as IP addresses, ports, client IDs, and sequence numbers. It then prints information about received or dropped packets, capitalizes headers and payloads, constructs response packets, and sends them back to the clients. The server manages packet communication, loss simulation, and responses, for a PING server-client interaction.
